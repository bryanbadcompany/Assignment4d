        Cute kittens are the most important thing in the world.<br>
        It is essential in the world that we have these amazing animals.<br>
        If we did not have kittens, more people would suffer from depression<br>
        Kittens are number 1 <br>
        Make sure your kitten is well loved.

    <h1>Cute Puppies</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="Images/cutepuppy.jpg" id="puppy" alt="Picture of Cute Puppy"> <br>
        Cute puppies are both playful and happy <br>
        It is hard not to like puppies since they are so friendly <br>
        If someone who liked puppies did not have one it would make them very sad <br>
        Puppies grow into dogs after they mature for some time <br>
        Make sure that your puppy is well loved.
